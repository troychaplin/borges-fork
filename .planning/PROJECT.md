# Project

## Name

Borges Bibliography Builder

## Summary

WordPress block plugin that converts DOI, BibTeX, and progressively enhanced
scholarly citation inputs into a semantically rich, static bibliography block
backed by CSL-JSON.

## Source of truth

-   `/Users/danknauss/Developer/GitHub/wp-bibliography-block/SPEC.md`

## Current focus

-   Post-launch GSD Phase 2 (performance/stability remediation) is committed
    (`3d5d3de`, `539b6b3`); next track is the post-Phase 2 feature backlog,
    starting with frontend Cite/Export affordances
-   The hidden 51-entry formatter cliff is now replaced by an explicit, tested
    50-total-citation policy for 1.x
-   Maintain CSL-JSON as the canonical citation model
-   Preserve static saved output / frontend-zero-JS bibliography rendering
